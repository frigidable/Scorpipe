# CODEOWNERS
#
# This file allows you to require reviews from designated owners when files
# matching specific patterns are changed.
#
# IMPORTANT:
# - If you enable "Require review from Code Owners" in branch protection / rulesets,
#   make sure the owners you list here EXIST, otherwise PRs may be blocked.
# - By default we keep this file empty to avoid accidental blocking.
#
# Example (uncomment and replace):
# * @octocat
# /docs/ @octocat
