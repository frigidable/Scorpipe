# Changelog

## v4.7

### UI / UX
- Added an always-visible **Inspector** dock (right side) with 3 tabs:
  - **Outputs** — expected products for the current step + existence checks.
  - **Plan** — RUN/SKIP decisions in *Resume* / *Force* modes.
  - **QC Alerts** — compact warnings/errors summary + quick-open.
- Added a richer **Status bar** with quick access to:
  - Data directory, Work directory, current config, QC report.
- Added keyboard shortcuts:
  - **Ctrl+I** Inspect dataset
  - **Ctrl+S** Save config
  - **Ctrl+R** Run all steps
  - **Ctrl+P** Run plan
  - **Ctrl+Q** QC viewer
- Dataset Overview now supports **multi-select** + **batch** actions:
  - Batch: build configs (per object)
  - Batch: run (non-interactive steps only; prepares LineID)

### Packaging / Release
- Version bump: pipeline **4.7**, python package **0.2.7**.
- Clarified the distribution model in docs: `setup.exe` is produced by the Windows build (GitHub Actions / local Windows build), and is not present in source archives.
